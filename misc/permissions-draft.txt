Permissions command
===================

Running the permissions command requires auth, and the permissions command cannot interfere with itself.

Groupless version
-----------------

# Blacklist command

`perms [command-name] american [nicks]`
`perms [command-name] blacklist [nicks]`

Upon running this command, [command-name] cannot be executed by [nicks], but others may do so.

» perms foocmd american foousr barusr bazusr
› Foousr, barusr and bazusr can no longer run the foocmd command

» perms foocmd blacklist
› Anyone can run the foocmd command

# Whitelist command

`perms [command-name] soviet [nicks]`
`perms [command-name] whitelist [nicks]`

Upon running this command, [command-name] can only be executed by [nicks]. No others may.

» perms barcmd soviet foousr barusr bazusr
› Only foousr, barusr and bazusr can run the barcmd command

» perms barcmd whitelist
› No one can run the barcmd command

Notes
	"American" and "Blacklist" are synonyms, as are "Soviet" and "Whitelist".
	The arglist is still `&rest args`.

Grouped version
---------------

Ae… groups are not hard to implement but the interactions between group and individual users
can get difficult.
